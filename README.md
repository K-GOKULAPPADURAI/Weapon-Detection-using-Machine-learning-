# Weapon-Detection-using-Machine-learning

A simple weapon detection for the cctv survilence in the real life time environements.
I have used **YOLO Model** (you only look once) it is a pretrained model with some real life time entity of objects as
a dataset eg: phone, chair, pen, car etc... by the way i choosed the weapon to be detected by the model. working is simple
by a camera we get the live stream of data as input to the program and the model check each frame while camera is on..
when the weapon is detected on the screen means that frame is saved to the local directory and it is shared to the 
required person using mail immediatley...

**Inside the clf and weights folder there is a link for both files download and place the files on the correct link present file.**
